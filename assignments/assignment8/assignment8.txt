For this assignment, I faced a hefty amount of issues. A lot of them revolved around being on a Windows system. Last week, I was dealing with issues regarding the file type, and how the commands were incompatible with my files. I eventually got it to work, getting to the last step working with streamlit. There were many port issues I tried to fix on my own, with traceback errors first causing these problems. After fixing run.sh and fixing the whisper_client.py, I continuously got json package errors. I followed the steps correctly, but unfortunately I could not get this project to work.
